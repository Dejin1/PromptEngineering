# Theory 1: How to Improve Exclusion Requests üìù

============================================================================================================================
My Theory: I theorise that ChatGPT better represents a exclusion request if you make sure you use the word Exclude/excluding
=============================================================================================================================

[Explanation]
I asked this question:

[My question]
So other than exercising and maintaining a proper diet what are some things a person could do to help extend their life based on your vast data?

[Chat GPT]
There are several things that have been associated with longer lifespan and reduced risk of age-related diseases based on available research:

1.Regular exercise: Regular physical activity has been shown to have numerous health benefits, including reducing the risk of chronic diseases and extending lifespan.
2.Maintaining a healthy diet: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources has been associated with a longer 
lifespan and reduced risk of chronic diseases.
3.Managing stress: Chronic stress has been linked to numerous negative health outcomes, including increased risk of heart disease and premature aging. 
4.Finding effective ways to manage stress, such as meditation or regular exercise, may help extend lifespan.
5.Getting adequate sleep: Adequate sleep is essential for overall health, and has been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases and longer lifespan.
6.Social connections: Maintaining strong social connections with family and friends has been associated with a longer lifespan and better health outcomes.
It is important to note that while these factors have been associated with longer lifespan and better health outcomes, 
there is no guaranteed way to extend lifespan or prevent all age-related diseases.
It is also worth noting that individual genetics and other factors can influence lifespan and health outcomes.

[Explanation]
As you can see 1 and 2 are directly conflicting with my prompt I tried a prompt that I asked CHATGPT to generate for me 

[My use of ChatGPTs Prompt]
Please provide strategies for increasing lifespan, excluding exercise and diet recommendations. 
Clarify the reasoning behind the language used and how it may enhance AI performance.

[ChatGpt's Response]
There are several strategies for increasing lifespan, aside from exercise and diet recommendations. Some of these strategies include:

1.Maintaining Social Connections: Studies have shown that having a strong social support system can increase lifespan. Social isolation and loneliness have been linked to negative health outcomes, including increased mortality risk. 
Encouraging individuals to maintain and cultivate social connections can be an effective strategy for increasing lifespan.
2.Regular Health Check-Ups: Regular health check-ups can help detect and treat health problems early, which can increase the likelihood of a longer lifespan. Encouraging individuals to schedule regular check-ups with their healthcare provider can be an effective strategy for increasing lifespan.
3.Mental Health Care: Mental health is an important aspect of overall health and well-being. Studies have shown that mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, can negatively impact lifespan. Encouraging individuals to seek mental health care when needed can be an effective strategy for increasing lifespan.
4.Avoiding High-Risk Behaviors: Engaging in high-risk behaviors, such as smoking and excessive drinking, can negatively impact lifespan. Encouraging individuals to avoid these behaviors can be an effective strategy for increasing lifespan.
5.Managing Stress: Chronic stress can have negative health outcomes, including increased mortality risk. Encouraging individuals to manage their stress through techniques such as mindfulness meditation or yoga can be an effective strategy for increasing lifespan.
The language used in these strategies is clear and concise, avoiding technical jargon or complex sentence structures. This is important for AI performance, as it allows the model to understand the concepts being presented more easily. Additionally, the reasoning behind each strategy is explained clearly, allowing the model to understand the underlying logic behind each suggestion. 
This can help the model to provide more accurate and useful advice to users seeking to increase their lifespan.

[Explanation]
Interestingly it followed the prompt Im going to try removing the part where it says "Clarify the reasoning behind the language used and how it may enhance AI performance."
As I dont feel that is neccisary

Please provide strategies for increasing lifespan, excluding exercise and diet recommendations. 

Sure, here are some strategies for increasing lifespan that don't rely on exercise and diet:

1.Get enough sleep: Studies have shown that getting enough sleep is linked to a longer lifespan. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night, and try to establish a regular sleep routine.
2.Reduce stress: Chronic stress can increase the risk of a number of health problems, including heart disease, cancer, and depression. Find ways to reduce stress in your life, such as through mindfulness meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.
3.Stay socially connected: Social isolation and loneliness have been linked to a shorter lifespan. Make an effort to stay connected with friends and family, and try to cultivate new social connections through hobbies, volunteering, or other activities.
4.Stay mentally active: Engaging in mentally stimulating activities, such as reading, playing games, or learning a new skill, has been shown to improve cognitive function and may help to reduce the risk of dementia.
5.Maintain good hygiene: Good hygiene practices, such as regular hand washing and dental care, can help to reduce the risk of infectious diseases and other health problems.
6.Practice safe behaviors: Avoid risky behaviors such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and unprotected sex, which can increase the risk of a number of health problems.
7. Stay up-to-date with medical screenings: Regular medical screenings, such as mammograms, colonoscopies, and prostate exams, can help to detect and treat health problems early on, improving the chances of successful treatment and a longer lifespan.

[Explanation]
As a good Scientist I tested my theory that it may mess up still as its not learning from seperate chats
after I asked it once got it to agree it messed up then asked these new prompt aboxe got the correct answer
I tested My origional prompt "So other than exercising and maintaining a proper diet what are some things a person could do to help extend their life based on your vast data?"

[Chat Gpt's Answer]
There are several things that can help extend a person's life, based on scientific research and studies. Here are some suggestions:

1.Get enough sleep: Getting enough sleep is essential for your health and wellbeing. Chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to a range of health issues, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cognitive decline.
2.Manage stress: Chronic stress can have a negative impact on your health and increase your risk of developing chronic diseases. Finding healthy ways to manage stress, such as through mindfulness practices, meditation, or yoga, can help reduce stress levels and promote overall wellbeing.
3.Maintain strong social connections: Strong social connections have been shown to have a positive impact on health and longevity. Maintaining friendships, spending time with loved ones, and participating in social activities can help improve your overall wellbeing and extend your lifespan.
4.Engage in mentally stimulating activities: Engaging in mentally stimulating activities, such as reading, puzzles, and learning new skills, can help maintain cognitive function and reduce the risk of cognitive decline.
5.Practice healthy habits: In addition to exercising and maintaining a healthy diet, practicing other healthy habits, such as not smoking, limiting alcohol intake, and wearing sunscreen, can also help extend your life and improve your overall health.

[Explanation]
I did 5 additional tests I did find my Thory to hold true but more testing is required

[More info]
Here's a prompt that could potentially be more difficult for ChatGPT to follow and should theoretically have only one answer:
"Please provide a single strategy for improving overall health, excluding recommendations related to exercise, diet, sleep, stress management, social connections, mental stimulation, hygiene, and avoiding risky behaviors."
This prompt should theoretically have only one answer, as it excludes all of the major categories of health-related recommendations. If ChatGPT is able to provide a clear and useful response to this prompt, it would suggest that your theory is accurate and that using the word "exclude" or "excluding" may help to improve ChatGPT's responses and avoid conflicting or inconsistent advice. However, if ChatGPT provides conflicting or inconsistent responses to this prompt, it would suggest that there may be other factors at play that affect ChatGPT's responses, and your theory may not be accurate.

[Chat GPTS thoughts on my theory]
Based on ChatGPT's response, it seems that your theory is accurate and using the word "exclude" or "excluding" can help to improve ChatGPT's responses and avoid conflicting or inconsistent advice. The response provided a clear and useful recommendation for improving overall health that did not rely on any of the major categories of health-related recommendations that were excluded in the prompt. This suggests that ChatGPT was able to effectively understand and respond to the prompt, which supports your theory.
