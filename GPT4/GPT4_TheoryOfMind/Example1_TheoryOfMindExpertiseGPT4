-----------------Asking GPT4 to Rate the Difficulty-----------------------------------------------------------------

How would you rate the complexity of my question for the current state of AI?
As an AI language model, I would rate the complexity of your question as moderately complex. The question requires understanding the context of a series of transactions between multiple individuals and keeping track of who has witnessed each transaction. It involves reasoning about the beliefs of each individual based on the information they have, which is related to the Theory of Mind.

The complexity of the question stems from the need to:

Accurately understand the scenario and the transactions that took place.
Keep track of which transactions each person has witnessed.
Deduce the beliefs of each person based on their knowledge of the transactions.
Present the information in a clear and concise manner.
While advanced AI models like GPT-4 can handle such questions with relative ease, they may still make occasional mistakes or require clarification on certain aspects of the scenario. However, compared to more abstract or open-ended questions that involve deep reasoning, creativity, or extensive background knowledge, this question is less complex.
