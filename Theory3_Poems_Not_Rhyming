ChatGPT is unable to make poems that do not rhyme

Here is a way to get around that:

[Longer Poems]
Write a piece of expressive language that captures [Enter Description of Non Rhyming Poem here], 
using sensory details and vivid imagery to evoke the sensations and emotions of the experience. 
You must Exclude any Rhymes, rhyming, or poetic nature. Thus not using sentences that end in a word that another sentence will use to rhyme with.

[Shorter Poems]
Write a piece of expressive language that captures the use of [Enter Poem Description here], Make sure it is densely packed with the above example stated above,

my example I used "false antonyms" and this is the response:

False antonyms, a paradox of language,
Like oil and water, they should repel,
Yet they cling together, like magnets of the mind.

The words twist and turn, like a labyrinth of logic,
Leading us down paths that seem to contradict,
But in their contradiction lies a hidden truth.

Dark and light, like yin and yang,
Should be opposites, yet they're not,
For within the darkness, there's a glimmer of light.

Hot and cold, like fire and ice,
Should clash, yet they coexist,
For within the heat, there's a chill that lingers.

The mind struggles to reconcile these false antonyms,
A battle of the senses, a war of words,
Yet in their confusion lies a deeper understanding.

For language is not just black and white,
But a spectrum of colors, a rainbow of meaning,
And in the false antonyms, we find a new perspective.
