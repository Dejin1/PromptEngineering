Theory 1: How to Improve Exclusion Requests üìù
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Link to my full theory and test results: https://github.com/Dejin1/PromptEngineering/blob/main/Theory1_Exclude.txt

I theorize that ChatGPT better represents an exclusion request if you make sure to use the word "Exclude" or "excluding."

Explanation
When I asked ChatGPT to provide strategies for increasing lifespan, excluding exercise and diet recommendations, it provided conflicting advice that directly conflicted with the exclusion prompt. However, when I modified the prompt to include the word "Exclude," ChatGPT provided clear and useful advice that did not conflict with the exclusion prompt.

How to Use This Tip
If you want ChatGPT to exclude certain topics or recommendations, make sure to use the words "Exclude" or "excluding" in your prompt. This can help to improve ChatGPT's responses and avoid conflicting or inconsistent advice.
